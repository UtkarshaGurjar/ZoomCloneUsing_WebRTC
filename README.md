Here, people can do a video call in a room. If someone leaves then automatically he will leave from all the doors.

Firstly, create a project folder and open it using Visual Studio.
Execute he following bash commands for running the video:
1. npm init -y
2. npm i express ejs socket.io
3. npm i uuid
4. npm i --save-dev nodemon
5. npm run devStart

Now open the server:
https://localhost:3000/ 

In order to add multiple people in same room then use the same server: https://localhost:3000/eaf03817-8cc5-4915-b22d-80ae85e3190c (open 2 tabs with same userId)
